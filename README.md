# My Dot Files

## Usage:
Only works on mac so far.
Note: This isn't tested on other platforms - I haven't prioritized testing because these are more personal.
If you want to install these dots, I would selectively choose which dot files you want to install
```
$ git clone git@github.com:lincketheo/dots.gith
$ ./setup.sh
```
